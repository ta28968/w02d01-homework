Create a new array called bondTitles with only the titles of the Bond films, and console.log the new array.

Create a new array oddBonds, of only the Bond films released on odd-numbered years.

Determine the total cumulative gross of the Bond franchise, and console.log the result.
Hint: To make the grosses into usable numbers, look into the .replace Javascript method (there are many ways to do this, however). Look into parseInt() also.

const cumulGross = 0
   for(let i = 0; i > bondFilms.length; i++){
     let gross = bondFilms[i].gross
     gross = gross.replace
